# Hi, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹


# TimTube (YouTube clone)

The objective of creating this YouTube clone is to showcase my skills with React with heavy use of hooks and API mapping. 

The languages & libraries I have used in this project include:
- HTML
- CSS 
- SCSS
- Javascript
- React


## Features

- Home Feed
- Search Function with channel & Video results

## Technical Features

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useParams etc.).
- SCSS mixins (Preset variables for screen sizes and themes).
- API manipulation.


## Lessons Learned

- **What did you learn while building this project?**

So far, this project has been simultaneously the most challenging yet exciting for me to implement. 

I learnt many skills whilst building this project, predominantly frontend. This project gave me a solid understanding of working with React's hooks and how state is managed in the virtual DOM. 

- **What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project was iterating through the Rapid API which I used to present data from YouTube.

It should be noted that although I faced quite a few different challenges in this project, I subsequently learnt a great deal from them. I plan on using much of the knowledge and problem solving techniques I gained in real world projects.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a web developer that is currently learning full stack development with a focus on the frontend. 

I love solving problems and continuously teaching myself new concepts. I have great interpersonal skills and i'm ready to apply myself technically to become a well rounded professional.
